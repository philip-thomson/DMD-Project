Good evening boss. After looking at this month's statistics, budget and overall expenses it seems that our company might be going under soon without drastic measures. To stay afloat I’d recommend we consider collection of the valuable resources within the nearby forests, rivers and flatland in order to generate more produce.
Please reconsider! Generations of my family have lived in those woods for years! My family, my livelihood, friends and neighbors all rely on the stability of the ecosystem to live! By expanding into the forests and rivers you’ll destroy our homes, taint the waters and pollute the air! Please consider us in your decision…
