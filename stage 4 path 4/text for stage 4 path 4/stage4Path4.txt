Good evening boss.
Was it successful? Have we found another solution?
No… we didn’t.
Our feathered friends were more helpful than I had anticipated, but we couldn’t find anything.
Really? Nothing at all?
Nothing. If you have to tear down our home, we’ll allow you to. We don’t see that you have any other choice.
Luckily for you but incredibly unluckily for us, we don’t have the option anymore.
What? Why?
We’ve gone bankrupt. We don’t have the resources to begin the exploitation of nature anymore. I warned you of this scenario, but I truly hoped that the help of the animals would be enough.
Really? So will our home be kept safe?
Yes. It will. I suppose you got what you wanted, boss. The local ecosystems are flourishing more than ever before.
Well, we could offer you a home with us. We have plenty of food and shelter for you.
Oh, no. I could never. I still have a home to go back to thankfully. I can’t speak for the boss however.
What about you?
Thank you for the offer, but I must pass. I don’t think I could spend my life in the wilderness.
Where will you go then?
I have plenty of savings that I can live off of for a time. While doing that I'll look for a new job I suppose.
Fair enough. The offer will stay open if you ever want to take it.
You know what, I'll take it.
Really? You love nature even more than I already thought.
We’ll make sure that you love it there! There’ll be a spot just for you.
The rest of the company has already been informed to seek alternative employment. So there’s nothing left for me to do. It was an honour serving you, boss.
I helped nature flourish, but I sacrificed my own company to do it. Is there really no way that I could've kept the company alive without exploiting the ecosystem?
